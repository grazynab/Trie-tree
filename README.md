# Trie
In this exercise I attempted to implement trie in Python
## What I aimed to learn
- How data structures work
- How to suggest privacy of methods with underscores
- About recursion
- How to test: using pytest, setting configuration for testing, fixtures, naming tests, what to test and what not to test, desirable test structure
